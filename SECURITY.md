# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in this application.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Sensitive credentials and API keys were hardcoded in source files.
**Fix**: 
- Moved all secrets to environment variables
- Created `.env.example` template
- Added validation for required environment variables
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from `config.js` and `server.js`

### 2. SQL Injection ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Direct string concatenation in SQL queries allowed injection attacks.
**Fix**:
- Implemented parameterized queries using prepared statements
- Added input validation for user IDs
- Limited returned fields to prevent data exposure
- Added proper error handling

### 3. Command Injection ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: User input was directly passed to shell commands.
**Fix**:
- Replaced `exec()` with `spawn()` for safer command execution
- Added input validation for hostnames and IP addresses
- Implemented command timeouts
- Used allowlist approach for file processing operations

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: User input was rendered without proper escaping.
**Fix**:
- Added input sanitization using `validator.escape()`
- Implemented Content Security Policy headers
- Added input length validation
- Proper HTML escaping for all user-generated content

### 5. Path Traversal ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: File paths were not validated, allowing directory traversal attacks.
**Fix**:
- Implemented proper path sanitization using `path.basename()`
- Added path validation to ensure files are within allowed directories
- Used `path.resolve()` to prevent traversal attacks
- Added file type and size validation

### 6. Weak Cryptography ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: MD5 hashing was used for password storage.
**Fix**:
- Replaced MD5 with bcrypt for password hashing
- Implemented proper salt rounds (12)
- Added password strength validation
- Removed hash exposure in production

### 7. Information Disclosure ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Debug endpoints exposed sensitive system information.
**Fix**:
- Removed or secured debug endpoints
- Limited information exposure in health checks
- Added authentication for debug access in development
- Removed sensitive data from logs

### 8. Unvalidated Redirects ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Redirect URLs were not validated, allowing open redirects.
**Fix**:
- Implemented URL validation and domain whitelisting
- Added HTTPS-only redirect policy
- Proper URL parsing and validation
- Error handling for invalid URLs

### 9. Insecure Direct Object Reference ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Users could access other users' data without authorization.
**Fix**:
- Added proper authorization checks
- Implemented user ownership validation
- Limited data exposure to necessary fields only
- Added authentication requirements

## Security Enhancements Added

### 1. Security Middleware
- **Helmet**: Adds various HTTP headers for security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization

### 2. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 3. File Security
- File size limits to prevent DoS
- Atomic file operations to prevent race conditions
- Safe file streaming for large files
- Proper file type validation

### 4. Database Security
- Connection pooling with limits
- SSL/TLS for production connections
- Prepared statements for all queries
- Connection timeout configuration

## Environment Variables Required

See `.env.example` for a complete list of required environment variables.

**Critical Variables** (must be set):
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `API_KEY`: API authentication key
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (min 32 chars)
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Encryption key (exactly 32 chars)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session signing secret

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and security
3. **Secure by Default**: Safe defaults for all configurations
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
5. **Output Encoding**: All outputs are properly encoded
6. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage
7. **Logging**: Security events are logged without exposing sensitive data

## Testing Security

To verify the fixes:

1. Run security audit: `npm run security-audit`
2. Test with invalid inputs to ensure proper validation
3. Verify environment variable validation works
4. Check that debug endpoints require authentication
5. Test rate limiting functionality

## Deployment Security

For production deployment:

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Configure all required environment variables
3. Use HTTPS/TLS for all connections
4. Enable database SSL
5. Configure proper CORS origins
6. Set up monitoring and alerting
7. Regular security updates

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for new security advisories
- Review logs for suspicious activity
- Conduct periodic security assessments
- Keep environment variables secure and rotated
